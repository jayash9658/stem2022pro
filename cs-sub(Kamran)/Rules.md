Hi Jayakanth, please follow these instructions while editing.

Script:
As said previously radiology can predict the internal problems and recognize the diseases.
We used machine learning to solve this problem. What we had done was to collect some structured and label data that is weather pneumonia or non-pneumonia patients.
We used a subranch of machine learning that is convolution neural network.

The CNN helped to analyze the edges of pneumonia spots and hence, recognized it.
Using the above data we trained the machine to analyze the data and hence predict the result weather it is True or False.

You can view the code on :

And finally we can see the result of 25 patients out of which only two predictions are wrong and 23 are right 

*display pnem-res-kam*

which accounts for about 

*display big 90%*

90% accuracy with a good speed.
